# Timeline for the Autumn 2023 Semester
This timeline was made as a rough plan for my work. Obviously it didn't exactly happen like this, but it gives an overview how how the project was structured.
## Week 34
- Background reading on the Cascadia fault line
## Week 35
- Access the Slab2 data
- Access the subsidence data
- Background reading on Slab2 and subsidence data
## Week 36
- Submit the masters agreement with NTNU
- Set up this github
- Set up a project report in overleaf
- Understand the Slab2 data we have
- Access the Slab2 data in R
## Week 37
- Plot the Slab2 data in R
- Plot the subsidence data in R
- Write a section in project report about Slab2
- Write a section in the project report about the subsidence data.
- Plot discretization of Slab2. INLA.mesh.2d. Make code flexible for creating different mesh's.
## Week 38
- Understand how to integrate Slab2 into Geoclaw
- Create geomtery for slab2 discretisation
- Work out which parts of the Geoclaw code I need for Okada model
- Begin coding
## Week 39
- Tesing the geometry
- Continue coding geoclaw in R
## Week 40
- Continue coding the Okada model in R
## Week 41
- Testing Okada model for an entire fault
- Rectangle into two triangles to compare to planar, dx, dy, dz
## Week 42
- Spatial Statistics modelling!
## Week 43
- Write up the maths for Negative Log Likelihood
- Think about Okada part of the math
- Begin on coding
## Week 44
- Continue SPDE coding
- Construct mesh
- Make Okada matricies, maybe block diagonal
## Week 45
- Continue coding
- Debugging
## Week 46
- Fit the model
- Debug
- Check results
## Week 47
- Write up
## Week 48
- More writing
## Week 49
- More writing
## Week 50
- Finish writing things from the first semester!
