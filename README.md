# Cascadia
This repository gives the data, code and resulting plots for my Master's thesis: "Spatial Inference of Coseismic Slip on the Cascadia Subduction Zone" written as the final part of my Master's degree in statistics at NTNU.

## The Modelling

Five spatial models are given in this repository, which are written in TMB files.

0. A Bayesian model that describes a singular earthquake;
1. An isotropic model that assumes earthquakes are independent of one another, but have an implicit link via model parameters;
2. An isotropic model that introduces a shared spatial component;
3. The anisotorpic version of model 1;
4. The anisotropic version of model 2.

The code can be freely used, but I cannot guarantee that it will be easy to compile on your own systems as it is not written specifically for sharing purposes.
