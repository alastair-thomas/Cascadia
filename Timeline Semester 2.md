# Spring 2024 Semester Timeline

Here is the timeline, to get the masters thesis finished by June 1st (Technically the 3rd but I will be done by the 1st).

## Week 2
- Get results using simple mesh

## Week 3
- Write up everything so far

## Week 4
- Get results using finer mesh: will need to use NTNU faster servers.
- Change write up to the finer mesh results.

## Week 5
- Find and add in more data sources
- Re-run simulations
- Add these data sources and results into the writing.

## Week 6
- Change to a Bayesian methodology

## Week 7
- Write up Bayesian stuff

## Week 8
After this I start to think about adding in more than one earthquake.
